                    While hanging drywall takes a little muscle, getting the drywall ready for paint or wallpaper
                    requires finesse. The goal
                    here is simple: Make the joints between drywall panels disappear so that walls and ceilings are
                    perfectly smooth.

                    Is It Hard to Finish Drywall?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The process isn’t com­plicated. It takes just a few tools—a small and a large drywall knife and a
                    swivel-head pole
                    sander—to finish drywall. Here, Paul Landry, of P.L. Drywall in Waltham, Massachusetts, shows us how
                    to mud and tape
                    drywall, using premixed joint compound (a.k.a. “drywall mud”) and drywall tape.

                    1. Drywall Finishing Steps Overview
                </h3>

                <p><br><br>
                    The tricky part is learning how to properly bed the tape and feather out the compound to an
                    imperceptible edge. "First
                    time out, you'll probably get more 'mud' on the floor and on your clothes than you do on the wall,"
                    says Landry, who
                    finished the walls at This Old House's recent TV project in Man­chester, Massachusetts.
                    <br><br>
                    Sanding is the other key skill. Joint compound is soft, so the challenge is to avoid removing so
                    much that you risk
                    fraying or tearing the paper tape. "Be patient," Landry advises. "Even beginners can do a fine job
                    if they take their
                    time."

                    2. Stir compound and prep surfaces

                    <li>
                        Cut band on top of the bucket with a utility knife or tin snips and pry off lid.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        If there's water on top of the compound, chuck a mixing paddle into a ½-inch drill. Mix at slow
                        speed until water is
                        blended and compound is smooth. If there's no water, the compound is ready to use.

                    <li>
                        Look for any screwheads poking above the drywall surface and drive them until slightly recessed.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Tear away any loose or torn paper from drywall (especially at corners and cut edges) to prevent
                        bits from ending up in
                        the compound.

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Load the edge of the knife blade with about 2 inches of compound.

                    </li><br>
                    <li>Starting in one corner of the room, force the compound into the joints between sheets. When
                        they're completely filled,
                        hold the knife at a 25-degree angle to the surface and smooth out the compound in a single pass.
                    </li><br>

                    <li>Scrape excess compound off knife and into mud box.

                    <li>
